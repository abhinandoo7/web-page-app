                    Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative AI) refers to a class of AI systems designed to
                    generate new content, data, or solutions by learning patterns from existing information. Unlike
                    traditional AI models that primarily focus on analyzing or classifying data, Generative AI creates
                    novel outputs that can mimic or extend the original data it was trained on. This technology has
                    gained significant attention and application across various industries due to its versatility and
                    innovative potential.

                    <li>Core Technologies Behind Generative AI</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Neural Networks: At the heart of Generative AI are deep learning models, particularly neural
                        networks that can learn complex patterns and representations from large datasets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014, GANs consist of
                        two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator—that work in tandem. The generator
                        creates data, while the discriminator evaluates its authenticity, leading to progressively more
                        realistic outputs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): VAEs are another type of generative model that learns to encode
                        data into a latent space and then decode it back, allowing for the generation of new data points
                        by sampling from this space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Transformer-Based Models: Models like OpenAI's GPT series use transformer architectures to
                        generate coherent and contextually relevant text, enabling applications in natural language
                        processing.
